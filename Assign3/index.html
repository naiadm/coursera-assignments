side of her nature; but now he seemed to be 
trying to understand the most intimate places 
of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but 
afterwards gratefully, she let him see the hid- 
den, kindly sides of her character. 

The most cunning man could not have crept 
into her confidence more successfully, evoking 
memories of the best times of her youth and 
showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's 
cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure 
in drawing out the human qualities of the 
embittered, hard, and (in her own way) proud 
princess. 

"Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he 
is not under the influence of bad people but 
of people such as myself," thought she. 

His servants too Ter^nty and Vdska in 
their own way noticed the change that had 
taken place in Pierre. They considered that he 
had become much "simpler." Ter^nty, when 
he had helped him undress and wished him 
good night, often lingered with his master's 
boots in his hands and clothes over his arm, 
to see whether he would not start a talk. And 
Pierre, noticing that Ter^nty wanted a chat, 
generally kept him there. 

"Well, tell me ... now, how did you get 
food?" he would ask. 

And Ter^nty would begin talking of the 
destruction of Moscow, and of the old count, 
and would stand for a long time holding the 
clothes and talking, or sometimes listening to 
Pierre's stories, and then would go out into 
the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with 
his master and affection for him. 

The doctor who attended Pierre and visited 
him every day, though he considered it his 
duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every 
moment was of value to suffering humanity, 
would sit for hours with Pierre telling him his 
favorite anecdotes and his observations on the 
characters of his patients in general, and 
especially of the ladies. 

"It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; 
he is not like our provincials," he would 
say. 

There were several prisoners from the 
French army in Orel, and the doctor brought 
one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre. 

This officer began visiting Pierre, and the 
princess used to make fun of the tenderness 
the Italian expressed for him. 

The Italian seemed happy only when he 
could come to see Pierre, talk with him, tell 
him about his past, his life at home, and his 
love, and pour out to him his indignation 



against the French and especially against Na- 
poleon. 

"If all Russians are in the least like you, it 
is sacrilege to fight such a nation," he said to 
Pierre. "You, who have suffered so from the 
French, do not even feel animosity toward 
them." 

Pierre had evoked the passionate affection 
of the Italian merely by evoking the best side 
of his nature and taking a pleasure in so do- 
ing. 

During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel 
his old Masonic acqaintance Count Willarski, 
who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, 
came to see him. Willarski was married to a 
Russian heiress who had a large estate in Orel 
province, and he occupied a temporary post 
in the commissariat department in that town. 

Hearing that Beziikhov was in Orel, Will- 
arski, though they had never been intimate, 
came to him with the professions of friendship 
and intimacy that people who meet in a desert 
generally express for one another. Willarski 
felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a 
man of his own circle and, as he supposed, of 
similar interests. 

But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed 
that Pierre had lagged much behind the times, 
and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, 
into apathy and egotism. 

"You are letting yourself go, my dear fel- 
low," he said. 

But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter 
now than it had been formerly to be with 
Pierre, and came to see him every day. To 
Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willar- 
ski, it seemed strange to think that he had been 
like that himself but a short time before. 

Willarski was a married man with a family, 
busy with his family affairs, his wife's affairs, 
and his official duties. He regarded all these 
occupations as hindrances to life, and consid- 
ered that they were all contemptible because 
their aim was the welfare of himself and his 
family. Military, administrative, political, and 
Masonic interests continually absorbed his 
attention. And Pierre, without trying to change 
the other's views and without condemning 
him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused 
smile now habitual to him, was interested in 
this strange though very familiar phenomenon. 

There was a new feature in Pierre's rela- 
tions with Willarski, with the princess, with 
the doctor, and with all the people he now 
met, which gained for him the general good 
will. This was his acknowledgment of the im- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 

possibility of changing a man's convictions by 
words, and his recognition of the possibility 
of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing 
things each from his own point of view. This 
legitimate peculiarity of. each individual which 
used to excite and irritate Pierre now became 
a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the 
interest he took in, other people. The differ- 
ence, and sometimes complete contradiction, 
between men's opinions and their lives, and be- 
tween one man and another, pleased him and 
drew from him an amused and gentle smile. 

In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt 
within himself a center of gravity he had pre- 
viously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary ques- 
tions, especially requests for money to which, 
as an extremely wealthy man, he was very fre- 
quently exposed, produced in him a state of 
hopeless agitation and perplexity. "To give or 
not to give?" he had asked himself. "I have it 
and he needs it. But someone else needs it still 
more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they 
are both impostors?" In the old days he had 
been unable to find a way out of all these sur- 
mises and had given to all who asked as long 
as he had anything to give. Formerly he had 
been in a similar state of perplexity with re- 
gard to every question concerning his property, 
when one person advised one thing and an- 
other something else. 

Now to his surprise he found that he no 
longer felt either doubt or perplexity about 
these questions. There was now within him 
a judge who by some rule unknown to him 
decided what should or should not be done. 

He was as indifferent as heretofore to money 
matters, but now he felt certain of what ought 
and what ought not to be done. The first time 
he had recourse to his new judge was when a 
French prisoner, a colonel, came to him and, 
after talking a great deal about his exploits, 
concluded by making what amounted to a 
demand that Pierre should give him four 
thousand francs to send to his wife and chil- 
dren. Pierre refused without the least difficulty 
or effort, and was afterwards surprised how 
simple and easy had been what used to ap- 
pear so insurmountably difficult. At the same 
time that he refused the colonel's demand he 
made up his mind that he must have recourse 
to artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the 
Italian officer to accept some money of which 
he was evidently in need. A further proof to 
Pierre of his own more settled outlook on 
practical matters was furnished by his decision 
with regard to his wife's debts and to the re- 



633 



building of his houses in and near Moscow. 

His head steward came to him at Orel and 
Pierre reckoned up with him his diminished 
income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, 
according to the head steward's calculation, 
about two million rubles. 

To console Pierre for these losses the head 
steward gave him an estimate showing that 
despite these losses his income would not be 
diminished but would even be increased if he 
refused to pay his wife's debts which he was 
under no obligation to meet, and did not re- 
build his Moscow house and the country house 
on his Moscow estate, which had cost him 
eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in 
nothing. 

"Yes, of course that's true," said Pierre with 
a cheerful smile. "I don't need all that at all. 
By being ruined I have become much richer." 

But in January Sav^lich came from Moscow 
and gave him an account of the state of things 
there, and spoke of the estimate an architect 
had made of the cost of rebuilding the town 
and country houses, speaking of this as of a set- 
tled matter. About the same time he received 
letters from Prince Vasili and other Peters- 
burg acquaintancesspeakingof his wife'sdebts. 
And Pierre decided that the steward's pro- 
posals which had so pleased him were wrong 
and that he must go to Petersburg and settle 
his wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. 
Why this was necessary he did not know, but 
he knew for certain that it was necessary. His 
income would be reduced by three fourths, 
but he felt it must be done. 

Willarski was going to Moscow and they 
agreed to travel together. 

During the whole time of his convalescence 
in Orel Pierre had experienced a feeling of 
joy, freedom, and life; but when during his 
journey he found himself in the open world 
and saw hundreds of new faces, that feeling 
was intensified. Throughout his journey he 
felt like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone 
the stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, 
the peasants on the roads and in the villages- 
had a new significance for him. The presence 
and remarks of Willarski who continually de- 
plored the ignorance and poverty of Russia 
and its backwardness compared with Europe 
only heightened Pierre's pleasure. Where Will- 
arski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary 
strength and vitality the strength which in 
that vast space amid the snows maintained the 
life of this original, peculiar, and unique peo- 
ple. He did not contradict Willarski and even

sions that could lead to nothingand he 
smiled joyfully as he listened to him. 

CHAPTER XIV 

IT WOULD BE difficult to explain why and whither 
ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurry- 
ing: some from the heap dragging bits of rub- 
bish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the 
heap, or why they jostle, overtake one another, 
and fight, and it would be equally difficult to 
explain what caused the Russians after the 
departure of the French to throng to the place 
that had formerly been Moscow. But when we 
watch the ants round their ruined heap, the 
tenacity, energy, and immense number of the 
delving insects prove that despite the destruc- 
tion of the heap, something indestructible, 
which though intangible is the real strength of 
the colony, still exists; and similarly, though 
in Moscow in the month of October there was 
no government and no churches, shrines, riches, 
or housesit was still the Moscow it had been 
in August. All was destroyed, except something 
intangible yet powerful and indestructible. 

The motives of those who thronged from all 
sides to Moscow after it had been cleared of 
the enemy were most diverse and personal, 
and at first for the most part savage and brutal. 
One motive only they all had in common: a 
desire to get to the place that had been called 
Moscow, to apply their activities there. 

Within a week Moscow already had fifteen 
thousand inhabitants, in a fortnight twenty- 
five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 
1813 the number, ever increasing and increas- 
ing, exceeded what it had been in 1812. 

The first Russians to enter Moscow were 
the Cossacks of Wint/ingerode's detachment, 
peasants from the adjacent villages, and resi- 
dents who had fled from Moscow and had been 
hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who en- 
tered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered 
it in their turn. They continued what the 
French had begun. Trains of peasant carts 
came to Moscow to carry off to the villages 
what had been abandoned in the ruined 
houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried 
off what they could to their camps, and the 
householders seized all they could find in other 
houses and moved it to their own, pretending 
that it was their property. 

But the first plunderers were followed by a 
second and a third contingent, and with in- 
creasing numbers plundering became more 



The French found Moscow abandoned but 
with all the organizations of regular life, with 
diverse branches of commerce and craftsman- 
ship, with luxury, and governmental and re- 
ligious institutions. These forms were lifeless 
but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, 
warehouses, market stalls, granaries for the 
most part still stocked with goods and there 
were factories and workshops, palaces and 
wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, 
prisons, government offices, churches, and 
cathedrals. The longer the French remained 
the more these forms of town life perished, 
until finally all was merged into one confused, 
lifeless scene of plunder. 

The more the plundering by the French con- 
tinued, the more both the wealth of Moscow 
and the strength of its plunderers was de- 
stroyed. But plundering by the Russians, with 
which the reoccupation of the city began, had 
an opposite effect: the longer it continued and 
the greater the number of people taking part 
in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the 
city and its regular life restored. 

Besides the plunderers, very various people, 
some drawn by curiosity, some by official duties, 
some by self-interesthouse owners, clergy, 
officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and 
peasants streamed in to Moscow as blood flows 
to the heart. 

Within a week the peasants who came with 
empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped 
by the authorities and made to cart the corpses 
out of the town. Other peasants, having heard 
of their comrades' discomfiture, came to town 
bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down 
one another's prices to below what they had 
been in former days. Gangs of carpenters hop- 
ing for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, 
and on all sides logs were being hewn, new 
houses built, and old, charred ones repaired. 
Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cook- 
shops and taverns were opened in partially 
burned houses. The clergy resumed the serv- 
ices in many churches that had not been burn- 
ed. Donors contributed Church property that 
had been stolen. Government clerks set up 
their baize-covered tables and their pigeon- 
holes of documents in small rooms. The higher 
authorities and the police organized the dis- 
tribution of goods left behind by the French. 
The owners of houses in which much property 
had been left, brought there from other houses, 
complained of the injustice of taking every- 



BOOK FIFTEEN 



635 



thing to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin; 
others insisted that as the French had gathered 
things from different houses into this or that 
house, it would be unfair to allow its owner 
to keep all that was found there. They abused 
the police and bribed them, made out esti- 
mates at ten times their value for government 
stores that had perished in the fire, and de- 
manded relief. And Count Rostopchin wrote 
proclamations. 

CHAPTER XV 

AT THE END of January Pierre went to Moscow 
and stayed in an annex of his house which had 
not been burned. He called on Count Ros- 
topchfn and on some acquaintances who were 
back in Moscow, and he intended to leave for 
Petersburg two days later. Everybody was cele- 
brating the victory, everything was bubbling 
with life in the ruined but reviving city. Every- 
one was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished 
to meet him, and everyone questioned him 
about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly 
well disposed toward them all, but was now 
instinctively on his guard for fear of binding 
himself in any way. To all questions put to 
himwhether important or quite trifling such 
as: Where would he live? Was he going to re- 
build? When was he going to Petersburg and 
would he mind taking a parcel for someone? 
he replied: "Yes, perhaps," or, "I think so," 
and so on. 

He had heard that the Rost6vs were at Kos- 
tromd but the thought of Natasha seldom 
occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleas- 
ant memory of the distant past. He felt him- 
self not only free from social obligations but 
also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, 
he had aroused in himself. 

On the third day after his arrival he heard 
from the Drubetsk6ys that Princess Mary was 
in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days 
of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's 
thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh 
vividness. Having heard at dinner that Prin- 
cess Mary was in Moscow and living in her 
house which had not been burned in Voz- 
dvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening 
to see her. 

On his way to the house Pierre kept think- 
ing of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of 
his various meetings with him, and especially 
of the last one at Borodin6. 

"Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame 
of mind he was then in? Is it possible that the 
meaning of life was not disclosed to him be- 



fore he died?" thought Pierre. He recalled 
Karataev and his death and involuntarily be- 
gan to compare these two men, so different, 
and yet so similar in that they had both lived 
and both died and in the love he felt for both 
of them. 

Pierre drove up to the house of the old 
prince in a most serious mood. The house had 
escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but 
its general aspect was unchanged. The old foot- 
man, who met Pierre with a stern face as if 
wishing to make the visitor feel that the ab- 
sence of the old prince had not disturbed the 
order of things in the house, informed him 
that the princess had gone to her own apart- 
ments, and that she received on Sundays. 

"Announce me. Perhaps she will see me," 
said Pierre. 

"Yes, sir," said the man. "Please step into 
the portrait gallery." 

A few minutes later the footman returned 
with Dessalles, who brought word from the 
princess that she would be very glad to see 
Pierre if he would excuse her want of cere- 
mony and come upstairs to her apartment. 

In a rather low room lit by one candle sat 
the princess and with her another person </p>
